The FreePBX Trunk Balancing Module
==================================

The FreePBX Trunk Balancing module can be used to limit usage of FreePBX trunks after defined thresholds
have been exceeded or to balance usage over multiple trunks. This module is used primarily to help users
create a "least-cost" route environment. 

This project is freely released under GNU GPL3 license

Installation:
Manually download the latest version of the module tarball from here:

http://pbxossa.org/files/trunkbalance/

Don't decompress the archive. In FreePBX, Module Admin, upload modules, browse to the tarball and upload
it to the PBX. The module will now be available to install/disable/uninstall in module admin like any other module.
